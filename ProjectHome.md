# Project Moved to Github #

While this project is not under active development, the codebase has been moved to Github: http://github.com/ajclarkson/ARMonkeyKit. Any future development revival will happen on that repository and **not** on Google Code

ARMonkeyKit is a framework which draws on the power of NyARToolKit and jMonkeyEngine to enable fast prototyping of Augmented Reality applications in the JAVA programming language. The framework aims to provide a single point of entry into the underlying technologies, greatly reducing the amount of code which is required from the developer.

A number of examples are provided in the source code, with commenting to show how to create your own Augmented Reality application using the framework, a more comprehensive guide will appear here in the future.

A development blog covering advances and examples of the use of this framework can be found at http://armonkeykit.wordpress.com

You can see a short video showing the frame rates which we can obtain using the framework on youtube:
